![Magic Auth in action](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9ccbb5d-4f42-48c6-9847-af51fec5b155)

## Key Features

- **Ship Faster** üöÄ: No time wasted configuring password resets and recovery flows - just implement and ship your product.
- **Passwordless Authentication** üì®: Secure login process through one-time passwords sent via email. One-time passwords are better than magic links because users can receive the code on one device (e.g., phone email) and enter it on another (e.g., desktop browser).
- **Enhanced Security** üîí: Protect your application from brute force attacks with built-in rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
- **Customizable Interface üé®:** Use the beautiful default UI components out of the box, or customize them fully to match your design perfectly.
- **Effortless Configuration and Comprehensive Documentation** üìö: Quick and simple integration with your Phoenix project, with detailed guides and references to assist you through every step of the integration process.
- **Schema Agnostic** üë§: Implement authentication without requiring a user schema - ideal for everything from MVPs to complex applications.
