## Key Features

- **Ship Faster** ðŸš€: No time wasted configuring password resets and recovery flows - just implement and ship your product.
- **Passwordless Authentication** ðŸ“¨: Secure login process through one-time passwords sent via email. One-time passwords are better than magic links because users can receive the code on one device (e.g., phone email) and enter it on another (e.g., desktop browser).
- **Enhanced Security** ðŸ”’: Protect your application from brute force attacks with built-in rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.
- **Customizable Interface** ðŸŽ¨: Fully customizable UI components to match your design.
- **Effortless Configuration and Comprehensive Documentation** ðŸ“š: Quick and simple integration with your Phoenix project, with detailed guides and references to assist you through every step of the integration process.
- **Schema Agnostic** ðŸ‘¤: Implement authentication without requiring a user schema - ideal for everything from MVPs to complex applications.

## Installation

To install Magic Auth, add it to your dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:magic_auth, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Getting started

Magic Auth simplifies the process of adding authentication to your Phoenix application. You'll have a fully functional authentication system integrated into your Phoenix application in less than 5 minutes. It's just 2 easy and quick steps!

### Step 1 - Run generator

After adding Magic Auth to your dependencies, you can quickly set up authentication in your Phoenix application using the installation generator:

```bash
mix magic_auth.install
```

If you are working within an umbrella project, navigate to your web application directory and run the generator:

```bash
cd apps/my_app_web/ && mix magic_auth.install
```

Don't forget to run the migrations to create the necessary tables for Magic Auth:

```bash
mix ecto.migrate
```

### Step 2 - Protect your routes

To protect your controllers and LiveViews with authentication, you need to configure the appropriate plugs and LiveView mounts. Edit the `lib/my_app_web/router.ex` file and modify it as shown in the example below:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do 
  # Additional router contents...

  scope "/", MyAppWeb do
    # Use MagicAuth.require_authenticated/2 plug to protect controllers
    pipe_through [:browser, :require_authenticated]

    get "/protected_controller", ProtectedController, :index

    # Use MagicAuth.required_authenticated/4 to protect LiveViews
    live_session :authenticated, on_mount: [{MagicAuth, :require_authenticated}] do
      live "/protected_live_view", ProtectedLiveView
    end
  end
end
```

For more details, refer to `MagicAuth.require_authenticated/2` and `MagicAuth.on_mount/4`.

## Customization
The generator will create a file at `lib/my_app_web/magic_auth.ex` (or at `apps/my_app_web/lib/my_app_web/magic_auth.ex` in an umbrella project). It contains several callbacks that you can modify to match your application's needs. Below is a brief explanation of each callback:

- Customize the log in form appearance by modifying `log_in_form/1`.
- Customize the verification form appearance by modifying `verify_form/1`.
- Customize email templates by modifying `one_time_password_requested/1`, `text_email_body/1`, and `html_email_body/1`.
- Customize access control logic by modifying `log_in_requested/1`.
- Customize error message translations by modifying `translate_error/1`.
